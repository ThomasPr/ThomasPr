# Hi there 👋 I'm Thomas!

I have 10+ years of experience as a Software Engineer in various technologies and companies. I studied abroad in the UK for almost a year and co-founded a startup.

My passion is to follow the KISS principle through the journey of a software project. To keep it small and simple is by far the most valuable and most challenging task. However, it’s so much worth it to get a maintainable project that’s fun to work on.
